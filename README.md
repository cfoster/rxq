The recent release of [MarkLogic 6](http://www.marklogic.com) included support for several [XQuery 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30) features. One such feature, annotations, provided the opportunity at attempting to implement Adam Retter's RESTXQ draft (introduced at XML Prague 2012). RESTXQ proposes a consistent and elegant approach for building web applications using XQuery.


# How RESTXQ works

``
declare %rxq:GET rxq:path('/address/id/(.*)') function local:get-address($id){ .... }
``


# Setting up the example-site

Create an appserver, provide the followig details;

* root: provide example-site directory
* error handler: /rxq-rewriter.xqy?mode=error
* rewrite handler: /rxq-rewriter.xqy?mode=rewrite

Navigate to the created app (e.g. http://<host>:<port>/) and you should see the following;

 test by reviewing module lib rxq:paths in browser

 # Limitations

The RESTXQ spec is still in draft form; where things were unclear I made my own impl decisions for the time being;
 
 * allow for full regex expressions within rxq:path, instead of binding by variable names
 * rxq:content-type provides return content-type
 * its the responsibility of underlying function to grab hold of a PUT or POST content body
 * added some more metadata to the output of rxq:resource-function()
